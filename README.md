## Teaching a computer to count by 10s (because apparently that's hard now)

A PyTorch neural network that learns the mystical art of multiplying by 10.

**The Mission:** Given a number from 1 to 10, return that number times 10. Revolutionary stuff, really.

Why use a neural network for this? Because sometimes you need a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and this nut is _really_ stubborn.

## What it does

- Input: Any number from 1-10
- Output: That number Ã— 10
- Method: Overkill (but fun overkill)

_"If a neural network multiplies by 10 in a forest, and no one is there to see it, does it still make a gradient descent?"_

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies
   - Run the neural network
   - Clean up after itself

_"In a world where calculators exist, one neural network dared to dream..."_

_"This project is a gentle reminder that sometimes the most elegant solution is to throw a neural network at a problem that could be solved with a single line of code. But where's the fun in that?"_

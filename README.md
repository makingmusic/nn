# nn

A PyTorch neural network that learns the mystical art of multiplying by 10.

## TL;DR (how to run)

```bash
./run.sh
```

That one-liner will:

1. conjure a virtual environment
2. pip-install the meaning of life (and `torch`)
3. let `nn.py` contemplate the decimal system

_"In a world where calculators exist, one neural network dared to dream..."_

Sometimes you have to throw 2 billion FLOPs at a problem solvable on a napkin. It builds characterâ€”and weight matrices.

_"This project is a gentle reminder that sometimes the most elegant solution is to throw a neural network at a problem that could be solved with a single line of code. But where's the fun in that?"_
